# -Habit-Tracker-App
For this project, youâ€™ll be setting up and using the database schema for a simple habit tracking app. This project will not have any UI components; instead, you will focus on what happens behind the scenes, practicing how to design and implement a simple database.  First, define and setup up the database schema (i.e. table and columns) that can be used to help a user keep track of their habits (e.g. walking the dog, practicing the saxophone, taking any medications). Then, create 2 methods that insert and read data to/from your database. These 2 methods can all be contained in a single Java file.
